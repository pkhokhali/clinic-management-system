## Issues Fixed

1. ✅ **SDK Version**: Upgraded to SDK 54 (matches your Expo Go)
2. ✅ **Dependencies**: Installed with --legacy-peer-deps
3. ✅ **Assets**: Removed icon requirements from app.json

## Next Steps

1. **Stop current Expo server** (if running): Press `Ctrl+C`

2. **Restart Expo:**
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

3. **Scan QR Code** with Expo Go on your phone:
   - Open Expo Go app
   - Scan the QR code
   - App should load!

## What to Expect

- Expo server will start
- QR code will appear
- After scanning, the Login screen should appear on your phone

## If Still Having Issues

Try clearing cache:
```powershell
npx expo start -c
```

The `-c` flag clears the cache and restarts fresh.
