# Assets Directory

Place your application icons here:

- `icon.ico` - Windows icon (256x256 or higher)
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon (1024x1024)
- `icon.png` - Linux icon (512x512 or higher)

These icons are used when packaging the application for distribution.

## Creating Icons

1. Start with a high-resolution PNG (1024x1024 or higher)
2. Convert to required formats:
   - **Windows (.ico)**: Use tools like ImageMagick or online converters
   - **macOS (.icns)**: Use `iconutil` on Mac or online converters
   - **Linux (.png)**: Use the PNG directly

## Quick Icon Creation

If you don't have icons yet, you can:
1. Use a placeholder image for development
2. Create simple icons using design tools
3. Download free icons from icon libraries

The app will run without icons, but they're required for production builds.
