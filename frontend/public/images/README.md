# Logo Instructions

## Adding Your Logo

1. **Remove white background from your logo image** before adding it here.
   - You can use tools like:
     - Online: Remove.bg, Photopea, or Canva
     - Desktop: Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.NET
   - Save the logo with a transparent background (PNG format recommended)

2. **Save the logo file** as `logo.png` in this directory (`frontend/public/images/`)

3. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Size: At least 200x200 pixels (larger is fine, it will be scaled)
   - Aspect ratio: Square or close to square works best
   - File size: Keep under 500KB for optimal performance

4. **File location:** 
   - The logo should be saved as: `frontend/public/images/logo.png`
   - The application will automatically use this file

## Current Status

⚠️ **Logo file not found yet.** Please add your `logo.png` file to this directory.
