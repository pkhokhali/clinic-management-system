LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

IMPORTANT: Before adding your logo file, please remove the white background.

1. REMOVE WHITE BACKGROUND FROM LOGO:
   - Use an image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, Remove.bg, etc.)
   - Remove/delete the white background
   - Save with transparent background (PNG format)

2. SAVE YOUR LOGO FILE:
   - File name: logo.png
   - Location: frontend/public/images/logo.png
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 200x200 to 400x400 pixels

3. REPLACE THIS FILE:
   - Once you have your logo ready, save it as "logo.png" in this directory
   - The application will automatically use it

The logo will appear in:
- Dashboard sidebar
- Login page
- Register page
- Browser tab (favicon)

If you see a broken image icon, it means the logo file is not found yet.
Make sure the file is named exactly "logo.png" and is in this directory.
